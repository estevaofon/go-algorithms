# 🧪 Go Algorithms

A study lab for the **Go** programming language through the implementation of classic algorithms and data structures.

## 📖 About the Project

This repository is a dedicated space for learning and practicing the Go language, where I implement everything from fundamental data structures to classic computer science algorithms.

## 🎯 Goals

- Deepen knowledge in the Go language
- Implement data structures from scratch
- Practice classic sorting, searching, and graph algorithms
- Document learning through clean and well-commented code

## 📂 Data Structures

| Structure | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Stack | `stack.go` | ✅ Implemented |
| Queue | - | 📝 Planned |
| Linked List | - | 📝 Planned |
| Binary Tree | - | 📝 Planned |
| Hash Table | - | 📝 Planned |
| Heap | - | 📝 Planned |
| Graph | - | 📝 Planned |

## 🔄 Algorithms

### Sorting
- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Selection Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort

### Searching
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Linear Search
- [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (version 1.18+)

### Running an algorithm

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-algorithms.git
cd go-algorithms

# Run a specific file
go run stack.go
```

### Expected Stack output

```
Is empty: false
[1 2 3]
Removed element: 3
[1 2]
Stack size: 2
```

## 📚 Stack

A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. The current implementation supports:

- `Push(value)` - Adds an element to the top
- `Pop()` - Removes and returns the top element
- `IsEmpty()` - Checks if the stack is empty
- `Size()` - Returns the stack size

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** Go
- **Version:** 1.18+
